KnowIt uses deep learning architectures derived from [``torch.nn.Module``](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html).
This guide explains how to import and manage new architectures. For details on the imported data structure see 
`KnowIt.data.base_dataset`.

## 1. Importing new architectures using Pytorch

To use an external architecture a new python script must be written that meets 
a number of criteria. This script can then be imported using the ``KnowIt.import_arch(new_arch_path=<path to script>)`` function.

The criteria are as follows:
1. The script must contain an ``available_tasks (tuple)`` variable that contains strings defining what type of task is currently supported by the model. KnowIt currently supports ``(regression, classification)``.
2. An ``HP_ranges_dict (dict)`` variable that provides the ranges of each hyperparameter, for tuning purposes.
3. A class called ``Model`` that inherits from [``torch.nn.Module``](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html).
    -   This class must take the following arguments:
        - **task_name** (str) = The current task to be performed by the model. 
        - **input_dim** (tuple) = The expected input dimensions of the model (t, c). Where t is the number of time steps (delays) and c is the number of input components. 
        - **output_dim** (tuple) = The expected output dimensions of the model (t, c). Where t is the number of time steps (delays) and c is the number of output components.
    - If the model is to perform classification, `output_dim` will be of the shape `[1, num_of_classes]`.
    - All other arguments are optional and default values must be provided.
    -   The class must also have a forward function that receives a Tensor of shape `[batch_size, in_chunk[b] - in_chunk[a], num_in_components]`, as argument, and produce a Tensor of shape `[batch_size, out_chunk[b] - out_chunk[a], num_out_components]`.
    - In the case of classification, the forward function must produces an output Tensor of shape `[batch_size, num_classes]`.
    - Additionally, if statefulness is desired, the following two methods must also be defined:
      - ``force_reset()``, accessable from outer scope. This method should reset all hidden and internal states. It is called at the start of train, validation, and testing loops.
      - ``update_states()`` it receives a Tensor of current IST indices of shape `[batch_size, 3]` as argument. This method can be used to handle statefulness. It is called at the start of each batch.

Note that the architecture will have the same name as the script being imported.

See default architectures for examples.

The imported architecure will be stored under ``/custom_archs`` in the relevant custom experiment output directory.
It can then be used to train a model by passing ``kwargs={'arch': {'name': <architecture name>, ...}, ...}`` when 
calling the ``KI.train_model`` function.

## 2. Useful functions

Use ``KI.available_archs()`` to see what architectures are available after importing.

## 3. Default architectures

While newly imported architectures are stored under ``/custom_archs`` in the relevant custom experiment output directory, 
default datasets are stored under ``KnowIt/default_archs``. There are currently four default architectures. 

 - MLP - A Multilayer perceptron architecture.
 - LSTM - A Long short-term memory architecture.
 - TCN - A Temporal convolutional architecture.
 - CNN - A 1D convolutional architecture.
