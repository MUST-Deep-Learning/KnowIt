   PreparedDataset
   ---------------

   The ``PreparedDataset`` represents a ``BaseDataset`` that is preprocessed for model training.
   It inherits from ``BaseDataset``. Based on the provided path(s) to a dataset, it will populate the
   parent's variables.

   -----------------
   Prediction points
   -----------------

   In order to define a ``PreparedDataset``, the input-output dynamics of the model to be trained
   must be defined rather precisely. The ``PreparedDataset`` is built on the idea of 'prediction points'.
   Each time step in the ``BaseDataset`` can be regarded a prediction point (under some assumptions).
   At every prediction point, a model is to predict a specific set of features-over-time from
   a specific other set of features-over-time. The specifics are defined as follows.

       in_components : list
           A subset of ``BaseDataset.components`` representing the components that will be used as input to the model.
       out_components : list
           A subset of ``BaseDataset.components`` representing the components that will be used as output to the model.
       in_chunk : list
           A list of two integers `[a, b]` for which `a <= b` defining the time steps (of `in_components`)
           to be used for prediction at point `t` as `[t + a, t + b]`.
       out_chunk : list
           A list of two integers `[a, b]` for which `a <= b` defining the time steps (of `out_components`)
           to be predicted at prediction point `t` as `[t + a, t + b]`.

   Note that this might seem cumbersome, but it allows us to easily define several different types of tasks.
   For example:

   - regression (predict heartrate from an 11 time-step window given three instantaneous biometrics)
       - in_components = [biometric1, biometric2, biometric2]
       - out_components = [heart rate]
       - in_chunk = [-5, 5]
       - out_chunk = [0, 0]
   - autoregressive univariate forecasting (predict a stock's value in 5 time steps given last 21 time steps)
       - in_components = [stock,]
       - out_components = [stock,]
       - in_chunk = [-20, 0]
       - out_chunk = [5, 5]
   - time series classification (detect a whale call given an audio recording of 5 time steps)
       - in_components = [sound,]
       - out_components = [positive_call,]
       - in_chunk = [-2, 2]
       - out_chunk = [0, 0]

   --------------------------
   Variable length processing
   --------------------------

   The ``PreparedDataset`` can also be defined in a "variable length" configuration.
   This means that instead of receiving and producing chunks of a specific number of time steps,
   the model will receive a variable number of time steps and produce an identical number of time steps as output.
   The input- and output components don't need to be the same. Not all architectures can facilitate this configuration.
   Currently, only ``LSTMv2``, ``TCN``, and ``CNN`` supports it.

   This configuration is selected by defining ``task=vl_regression``, ``batch_sampling_mode=variable_length``,
   selecting an appropriate architecture, and ensuring that the size of ``in_chunk`` and ``out_chunk`` are both 1.
   Classification tasks are not currently supported for this configuration.

   Examples of tasks that can be defined with this configuration include:

   - regression (predict heartrate from the change in three instantaneous biometrics over time)
       - in_components = [biometric1, biometric2, biometric2]
       - out_components = [heart rate]
       - in_chunk = [0, 0]
       - out_chunk = [0, 0]
   - autoregressive univariate forecasting (predict a stock's value in 5 time steps given its value in the past)
       - in_components = [stock,]
       - out_components = [stock,]
       - in_chunk = [0, 0]
       - out_chunk = [5, 5]


   --------------------
   Splitting & Limiting
   --------------------

   The first step in preparing the dataset is to split it into a train-, validation-,
   and evaluation set. This is done with the ``DataSplitter`` module.
   The ``split_method`` data keyword argument defines the way the dataset is split.
   More details can be found in ``DataSplitter``, but we summarize the options here:
       - 'random': Ignore all distinction between instances and slices, and split on time steps randomly.
       - 'chronological' (default): Ignore all distinction between instances and slices, and split on time steps chronologically.
       - 'slice-random': Ignore all distinction between instances, and split on slices randomly.
       - 'slice-chronological': Ignore all distinction between instances, and split on slices chronologically.
       - 'instance-random': Split on instances randomly.
       - 'instance-chronological': Split on instances chronologically.
       - 'custom': User defined split.
   Note that the data is split ON the relevant level (instance, slice, or timesteps).
   I.e. If you split on instances and there are only 3 instances, then split_portions=(0.6, 0.2, 0.2)
   will be a wild approximation i.t.o actual time steps.

   Note that, if desired, the data is limited during splitting, and the data is limited by removing
   the excess data points from the end of the data block after shuffling or ordering according to time.
   Also note that if the data is limited too much for a given ``split_portion`` to have a single entry,
   an error will occur confirming it.

   Note that a 'custom' split can be constructed during the data importing.
   See the ``RawDataConverter`` module for more information.

   -------
   Scaling
   -------

   After the data is split, a scaler is fit to the train set data
   which will be applied to all data being extracted for model training or inference.
   This is done with the ``DataScaler`` module and the corresponding ``scaling_method`` and ``scaling_tag``,
   data keyword arguments. More details can be found there, but we summarize the options here:
       - scaling_method='z-norm': Features are scaled by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
       - scaling_method='zero-one': Features are scaled linearly to be in the range (0, 1).
       - scaling_method=None: No scaling occurs.
       - scaling_tag='in_only': Only the input features will be scaled.
       - scaling_tag='full': The input and output features will be scaled.
       - scaling_tag=None: No features will be scaled.
   Note that scaling of output components is not permitted if performing a classification task. ``scaling_tag``='full' will be
   automatically changed to ``scaling_tag``='in_only' for classification tasks.
   Also note that the scaling happens "online" as data is sampled from disk.

   -------
   Padding
   -------

   At some prediction points the ``in_chunk`` might exceed the corresponding
   slice range. In these cases we pad the input values. The output values are never padded.
   Prediction points that do not have valid output values for an ``out_chunk`` are not selected
   as appropriate prediction point during data splitting. The argument ``padding_method`` is the same
   as ``mode`` in the numpy.pad function (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html).
   See the ``DataSplitter`` module for more information.

   -------------
   CustomDataset
   -------------

   ``PreparedDataset.get_dataloader()`` can be called to return a Pytorch dataloader that can be used for model training.
   This function compiles a dataloader with a ``CustomDataset`` class.
   This class inherits from ``torch.utils.data.Dataset``.
   It defines how the samples will look when enumerating over the dataloader.
   This includes sampling, padding, and normalizing.

   ---------------------------
   CustomClassificationDataset
   ---------------------------

   If the task is a classification task a ``CustomClassificationDataset`` will be used instead of ``CustomDataset``.
   ``CustomClassificationDataset`` inherits from ``CustomDataset`` and adds some classification specific methods.

   -------------------------------------
   CustomVariableLengthRegressionDataset
   -------------------------------------

   If the task is a variable length regression task a ``CustomVariableLengthRegressionDataset`` will be used instead of ``CustomDataset``.
   ``CustomVariableLengthRegressionDataset`` inherits from ``CustomDataset`` and adds some variable length regression specific methods.

   -------------
   CustomSampler
   -------------

   In addition to ``CustomDataset``, ``PreparedDataset`` also uses a custom batch sampler ``CustomSampler``
   when ``PreparedDataset.get_dataloader()`` is called to generate a dataloader.
   This class supports three different modes of temporal contiguity.
       - 'independent': Time is contiguous within sequences (i.e. prediction points) but not enforced within or across batches.
       - 'sliding-window': Time is contiguous within sequences and across batches, as far as possible.
       - 'variable_length': Time is contiguous within sequences and across batches, as far as possible. Batches are also variable (but uniform) in length.
   See the ``CustomSampler`` module for details.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - mode='independent': Time is contiguous within sequences but not across batches.
   - mode='sliding-window': A sliding window approach is used to ensure that time is contiguous within sequences and across batches.
   - mode='inference': Same as 'sliding-window', but no shuffling, expansion for batch sizing, and striding.
   - mode='variable_length': Similar to 'sliding-window' but the sequence lengths will be variable within batches.
   - mode='variable_length_inference': Same as 'variable_length', but no shuffling or expansion for batch sizing.
   - shuffle=False: Batches are constructed in dataset order as per the "selection" array. For variable length modes, slices will also be samples in descending order of length.
   - shuffle=True:
       - mode='independent': Sequences within and across batches are randomly shuffled.
       - mode='sliding-window' or 'variable_length': Slices are shuffled before and after expansion, and a random number of prediction points (between 0 and 10) at the start of each slice are dropped before batches are constructed.


   .. py:method:: set_epoch(epoch)

      If the next epoch not already set, sets the next epoch and regenerate batches according to the sampling mode.

      This method updates the internal epoch counter and triggers batch generation
      based on the configured mode. It is intended to be called by the training loop
      (e.g., a PyTorch Lightning model wrapper) at the end of each epoch.

      :Parameters: **epoch** (:py:class:`int`) -- The next epoch number.

      Supported modes:
      - 'independent': Generates batches without enforcing temporal continuity.
      - 'sliding-window': Generates batches using a sliding window approach for temporal consistency.
      - 'inference': Prepares batches for model inference.

      - 'variable_length_inference': Prepares variable length batches for model inference.

      Additional checks are performed to ensure that batches meet size requirements.

                * **x_map** (:py:class:`array`, :py:class:`shape=[n_in_components,]`) -- An array that contains the indices of BaseDataset.components that correspond to input components.
                * **y_map** (:py:class:`array`, :py:class:`shape=[n_out_components,]`) -- An array that contains the indices of BaseDataset.components that correspond to output components.
                * **x_scaler** (:py:class:`object`) -- The scaler fitted to the training set input features.
                * **y_scaler** (:py:class:`object`) -- The scaler fitted to the training set output features.
                * **in_chunk** (:py:class:`list`, :py:class:`shape=[2,]`) -- A list of two integers [a, b] for which a <= b,
                  defining the time steps of in_components for each prediction point.
                * **out_chunk** (:py:class:`list`, :py:class:`shape=[2,]`) -- A list of two integers [a, b] for which a <= b,
                  defining the time steps of out_components for each prediction point.
                * **padding_method** (:py:class:`str`) -- The method to pad model inputs with.
                  Options can be found at (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html).
                  See heading for description.
                * **preload** (:py:class:`bool`, *default* :py:obj:`False`) -- Whether to preload the dataset into memory.
