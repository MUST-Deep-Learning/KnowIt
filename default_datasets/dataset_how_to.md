This directory contains the default datasets currently available in Knowit.
Each script represents a different dataset, sharing the same name as the script.

To use an external dataset, a pickle of a dataframe can be imported using the KnowIt.import_dataset method.
See the heading of the data.raw_data_conversion.py script for more details on requirements.
This will save a custom dataset in the relevant experiment output directory.
